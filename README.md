# Numerical methods
a series of numerical methods, coded in python language. numpy, scipy and sympy are used quite heavily in these codes, so in order to use these files you have to install these modules. usage guidance is provided within the codes by comments, docstring and even printing instruction. reading these modules is strongly recommended to avoid any possible errors.

codes that are uploaded in this repository are:
1) Gaussian Elimination with Complete Pivoting (GECP) method
2) Gauss sidel method
3) Householder QR factorization method
4) Jacobi method
5) Bisection roots finding method
6) Fourth order runge-kutta method
7) Lagrange interpolation method
8) Linear Least Squares method
9) Newton divided differences interpolation method
10) Newton-Newton (Newton-Raphson) roots finding method
11) Numerical derivation
12) simpson integration method
13) trapezoid integration method
14) Gram-Shmidt QR factorization method
15) Fourier Series
