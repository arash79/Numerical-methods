# Numerical methods
a series of numerical methods, coded in python language. numpy, scipy and simpy are used quite heavily in these code so in order to use these file you have to install these modules. usage guidance is instructed inside the codes itself by comments, docstring and even printing instruction. but I strongly recommend to read these modules document to avoid any possible errors.

codes that are uploaded in this repository are:
1) Gaussian Elimination with Complete Pivoting (GECP) method
2) Gauss sidel method
3) Householder QR decomposition method
4) Jacobi method
5) bisection method
6) fourth order runge-kutta method
